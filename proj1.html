		<p>Paris is the capital and largest city of France. It is situated on the river Seine, in northern France, at the heart of the &Icirc;le-de-France region.</p>
		<p>An important settlement for more than two millennia, Paris had become, by the 12th century, one of Europe's foremost centres of learning and 
		the arts and the largest city in the Western world until the 18th century. Paris is today one of the world's leading business and cultural 
		centres, and its influences in politics, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one
		of the world's major global cities. It hosts the headquarters of many international organizations such as UNESCO, the OECD, the 
		International Chamber of Commerce and the European Space Agency. Paris is considered one of the greenest and most liveable cities in 
		Europe. It is also one of the most expensive cities.</p>
		<p>Paris and the Paris Region, with &euro;572.4 billion (US&#36;759.9 billion) in 2010, produce more than a quarter of the gross domestic product 
		of France and is, along with London, Europe's biggest city economy and one of the largest in the world. The Paris region is the first in 
		Europe in terms of research and development capability and expenditure and through its 17 universities and 55 grandes &eacute;coles has the 
		highest concentration of higher education students in the European Union. With about 42 million tourists annually in the city and its suburbs,
		Paris is the most visited city in the world. The city and its region contain 3,800 historical monuments and four UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
		</p>
		<h2>Etymology</h2>
		<p><img src="images/place7.jpg" alt="Paris " width="300px" />The name Paris derives from that of its earliest inhabitants, the Gaulish tribe known as the Parisii. The city was called Lutetia 
		(more fully, Lutetia Parisiorum, "Lutetia of the Parisii"), during the Roman era of the 1st to the 6th century, but during the reign 
		of Julian the Apostate (360&ndash;363), the city was renamed Paris.
		It is believed that the name of the Parisii tribe comes from the Celtic Gallic word parisio meaning "the working people" or "the craftsmen."
		Paris has many nicknames, but its most famous is "La Ville-Lumi&egrave;re" ("The City of Light"), a name it owes first to its fame as a centre of 
		education and ideas during the Age of Enlightenment, and later to its early adoption of street lighting.
		</p>
		<h2>Climate</h2>
		<p><img src="images/place11.jpg" alt="Paris" width="300px" />Paris has the typical Western European oceanic climate which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. Over a year, Paris' climate
		can be described as mild and moderately wet.</p>
		<p>Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures hovering between 15 and 25 &deg;C, and a fair amount of sunshine. 
		Each year, however, there are a few days where the temperature rises above 32 &deg;C (90&#160;&deg;F). Some years have even witnessed some 
		long periods of harsh summer weather, such as the heat wave of 2003 where temperatures exceeded 30 &deg;C(86&#160;&deg;F) for weeks, surged
		up to 40 &deg;C(104&#160;&deg;F) on some days and seldom cooled down at night. More recently, the average temperature for July 2011 was +17.6 &deg;C,
		with an average minimum temperature of 12.9 &deg;C and an average maximum temperature of 23.7 &deg;C.</p>
		<p>Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and fresh nights, but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs
		frequently in both seasons.</p>

		<p>In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cold but generally above freezing with temperatures around 7 &deg;C(45&#160;&deg;F). Light night frosts 
		are however quite common, but the temperature will dip below -5 &deg;C(23&#160;&deg;F) for only a few days a year. Snowfall is rare, but the city
		sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation. Recently, notably in 2009, 2010 and 2011, intense cold waves brought 
		repeated heavy snowfalls (15&#160;cm (5.91&#160;in) during one of December 2010's fourteen snowstorms) and temperatures plummeting to
		-10 &deg;C(14&#160;&deg;F) and -20 &deg;C(-4&#160;&deg;F) in the Paris suburbs.</p>
		<p>Rain falls throughout the year, and although Paris is not a very rainy city, it is known for heavy sudden showers. Average annual 
		precipitation is 652&#160;mm (25.7&#160;in) with light rainfall fairly distributed throughout the year. The highest recorded temperature 
		is 40.4 &deg;C(105&#160;&deg;F) on 28 July 1948, and the lowest is a -23.9 &deg;C(-11&#160;&deg;F) on 10 December 1879.</p><br />
