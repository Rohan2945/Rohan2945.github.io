		<h1>Must see sites</h1>
    	<p>
			First visits to Paris can be daunting: nearly every square inch of the city seems to be seeping with history and beauty. 
			All of it is worth seeing and exploring, but there are some Paris tourist attractions that simply shouldn't be missed. 
			Here are ten of the best Paris sights and attractions, chosen for their mass popularity, historical importance, or sheer aesthetic appeal. 
			If you want to experience Paris' most essential attractions, this guide will help you pinpoint what to see and do first.
    	</p>
			<h2>Boat Tour of the Seine River</h2>
			<img src="images/at1.jpeg" alt="Boat Tour of the Seine River" width="250px" />
			<p>Seeing some of Paris' most beautiful sites glide past as you drift down the Seine river is an 
					unforgettable and essential experience. Companies such as Bateaux Parisiens offer 1-hour tours of the Seine year-round for about 10 
					Euros. You can hop on near Notre Dame or the Eiffel Tower. Go at night to enjoy the shimmering play of light on the water, and dress
					warmly-- the wind from off the Seine can be chilly. You can also take tours of some of Paris' canals and waterways, which will allow 
					you to see a semi-hidden side of the city of light. </p><br />

			<h2>P&#232;re Lachaise Cemetery</h2>
			<img src="images/at2.jpeg" alt="P&#232;re Lachaise Cemetery" width="250px" />
			<p>Paris counts within its walls many of the world's most poetic cemeteries-- but P&#232;re Lachaise outdoes 
					them all. Countless famous figures are buried here: the most popular being <i>The Doors</i> lead singer Jim Morrison, whose tomb is 
					kept constant vigil by fans. The French playwright Moli&#232;re, Oscar Wilde, Edith Piaf, and Richard Wright are a few others. On a 
					sunny day, climbing to the cemetery's summit and looking down on the lavishly designed crypts can be surprisingly joyful.</p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>Sacre Coeur and Montmartre</h2>
			<img src="images/at3.jpeg" alt="Sacre Coeur and Montmartre" width="250px" />
			<p>With its unmistakeable white dome, the Sacre Coeur sits at the highest point of Paris on the 
					Montmartre knoll, or butte. This basilica, which was consecrated in 1909, is best-known for its garish gold mosaic interiors and for
					its dramatic terrace, from which you can expect sweeping views of Paris on a clear day. Take the funicular up with a metro ticket and
					stop off at Sacre Coeur before exploring the winding, village-like streets of Montmartre. And after expending all your energy climbing 
					Montmartre's formidable hills and stairs, consider a traditional Parisian cabaret at the legendary Moulin Rouge. </p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>Centre Georges Pompidou and the "Beaubourg" Neighborhood</h2>
			<img src="images/at4.jpeg" alt="Centre Georges Pompidou and the Beaubourg Neighborhood" width="250px" />
			<p>Parisians consider the Centre Georges Pompidou to be the cultural pulse 
					of the city. This modern art museum and cultural center, located in the neighborhood affectionately dubbed Beaubourg by locals, opened 
					in 1977 to honor president Georges Pompidou. The Center's signature skeletal design, which evokes bones and blood vessels, is either 
					loved or reviled-- no in-betweens. If wacky design isn't your cup of tea, the permanent collection at the National Museum of Modern Art 
					is a must and features works by Modigliani and Matisse. Rooftop views of the city are also in order.</p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elys&#233;es</h2>
			<img src="images/at5.jpeg" alt="Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elys&#233;es" width="250px" />
			<p>The 164-foot Arc de Triomphe commissioned by Emperor Napol&#233;on I does exactly 
					what it was made to do: evoke sheer military power and triumph. It was built in an age when leaders erected monuments in their own honor,
					and scaled to their egos. The arch's beautiful sculptures and reliefs commemorate Napol&#233;on's generals and soldiers. Visit the 
					Arc de Triomphe to begin or culminate a walk down the equally grandiose Avenue des Champs-Elys&#233;es.</p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>The Sorbonne and the Latin Quarter</h2>
			<img src="images/at6.jpeg" alt="The Sorbonne and the Latin Quarter" width="250px" />
			<p>The Sorbonne University is the historic soul of the Latin Quarter, where higher learning has
					flourished for centuries. Founded in 1257 for a small group of theology students, the Sorbonne is one of Europe's oldest universities. 
					It has hosted countless great thinkers, including philosophers Ren&#233; Descartes, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir. Enjoy a 
					drink on the caf&#233; terrace in front of the college before exploring the winding little streets of the Latin Quarter behind it.</p>
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay</h2>
			<img src="images/at7.jpeg" alt="Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay" width="250px" />
			<p>Walk over the bridge from the Louvre to the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay-- and see the bridge between classical 
					and modern art. Housing the world's most important collection of impressionist and post-impressionist painting, the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay's 
					light, airy rooms whir you through three floors of modern wonders, from Degas' ethereal dancers to Monet's water lilies, all the way 
					to Gaugin's leafy jungles. Major works by Van Gogh, Delacroix, Manet, and others await you, too.</p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
			<img src="images/at8.jpeg" alt="Eiffel Tower" width="250px" />
			<p>More than any other landmark, the Eiffel Tower has come to represent an elegant and contemporary Paris. 
					The iron tower, which was built for the 1889 World Exposition by Gustave Eiffel, was wildly unpopular with Parisians when it was 
					unveiled, and was nearly torn down. It has since attracted over 220 million visitors, and it would be hard to imagine Paris now 
					without it. The tower crowns the Paris night sky with its festive light, and glitters up a storm every hour.</p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>Notre Dame Cathedral</h2>
			<img src="images/at9.jpeg" alt="Notre Dame Cathedral" width="250px" />
			<p>No first trip to Paris is complete without a visit to this marvel of gothic architecture. One of the most 
					singular and beautiful cathedrals of Europe, Notre Dame Cathedral's dramatic towers, spire, stained glass and statuary are guaranteed 
					to take your breath away. Witness firsthand the spot that was once the heartbeat of medieval Paris, and that took over 100 years of 
					hard labor to complete. Climbing the North tower to see Paris from the hunchback Quasimodo's vantage is essential, too. </p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h2>The Louvre</h2><br />
			<img src="images/at10.jpeg" alt="The Louvre" width="250px" />
			<p>The Louvre is the site of the world's largest and most diverse collection of pre-20th century painting, sculpture, and 
					decorative objects, The Louvre is definitely one of Paris' most coveted attractions. Not forgetting the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo,
					bask in the works of Vermeer, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and countless others. The palace itself is testament to a rich history spanning 
					from the medieval period to the present.</p><br /><br />
