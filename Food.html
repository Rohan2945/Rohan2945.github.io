		<h1>Food and restaurants in Paris</h1><br />
		<p><img src="images/fd4.jpeg" alt="Food" width="300px" />For Parisians, how food looks on a plate is just as important as how it tastes. Colors, textures, and garnishes are impeccably 
		arranged, not only at haute cuisine establishments, but small, simple restaurants where even a humble hot chocolate is sometimes 
		poured in a heart shape on the cup's inside edge.<br /><br />To natives, having a meal is more than merely eating, but rather an intimate ceremony by the chef, waiter and patron. An unspoken etiquette pays homage to all those involved in the banqueting experience. 
		Things like waiting for the check, talking loudly or requesting for a "leftover box", are all insults to the restaurant staff and 
		diners. Parisians take pride in the union of the eating experience and cuisine as an inseparable art form.<br /><img src="images/fd1.jpeg" alt="Le Meurice" width="300px" /><br />On that note, the 
		aesthetic presentation is just as central to a dish as its taste in Paris. Chefs are not only meticulously trained in saut&eacute;ing 
		and knife-work, but skilled in flawlessly pairing vivid colors and textures together on a plate. Both quaint cafes and large 
		brasseries pepper their dishes with creative flair and style.<br /><br />Francophiles revel in each of the dining experience steps, from 
		the prep, cooking, serving and savoring of the food. Paris is a city infused by both regional flavors and worldly tastes, making 
		it the international spot for exquisite and imaginative gastronomy.<br /></p>
		<h2>Popular restaurants</h2><br />
			<h3>Le Meurice</h3>
			<img src="images/rt1.jpeg" alt="Le Meurice" width="250px" />
			<p>Anyone wanting a grand-slam experience of Gallic gastronomic grandeur won't do better than the glamorous dining room at the Hotel 
			Meurice in the heart of the city. Though it was redecorated by Philippe Starck several years ago, it's good French bones survived intact
			&#8211; mosaic floor, crystal chandeliers, heavy damask curtains at the windows overlooking the Tuileries Gardens across the street &#8211; and the 
			magnificent space is animated by old-school but friendly service that's as precise as a minuette. Chef Yannick All&eacute;no bagged a third
			Michelin star in 2007, and his brilliantly inventive cooking is based on a deep knowledge of classical Escoffier vintage culinary technique. 
			<br /><br /><em>&#8226; 228 rue de Rivoli, 1st, + 33 1 44 58 10 10. M&eacute;tro: Tuileries. Open for lunch and dinner from Mon-Fri. Average &euro;200.
			Jackets compulsory at dinner </em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>L'Astrance</h3>
			<img src="images/rt2.jpeg" alt="L'Astrance" width="250px" />
			<p>Despite the vertiginous prices of Paris haute cuisine, a meal at one of these tables is an investment that just can't disappoint, 
			and snagging a sought-after table at chef Pascal Barbot's three-star restaurant on a cobbled side street in the 16th arrondissement is 
			well worth persistence. The smallest and most casual table at the top of the Parisian food chain, this high-ceilinged dining room with 
			mirrored walls, widely spaced tables and friendly service offers a decidedly 21st-century take on French haute cuisine. Barbot, who
			trained with Alain Passard and once served as chef to the admiral of the French Pacific fleet, loves vegetables, fruit and fresh herbs, 
			and his style is brilliantly witty and deeply imaginative, as seen in signature dishes such as his galette of finely sliced button mushrooms 
			and verjus marinated foie gras dressed with hazelnut oil, or turbot with baby spinach and sea urchins, both of which are part of his regularly 
			changing tasting menus. <br /><br /><em>&#8226; 4 rue Beethoven, 16th, +33 1 40 50 84 40. M&eacute;tro: Passy. Open for lunch and dinner Tues&#8211;Fri. Average lunch &euro;80,
			average dinner &euro;200</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Huitrerie Regis</h3>
			<img src="images/rt3.jpeg" alt="Huitrerie Regis" width="250px" />
			<p>Tucked away in the heart of Saint Germain des Pres, this snug shop-front table with a white facade and interior is the best place in 
			Paris for a fix of impeccably fresh oysters, which are delivered directly from France's Marennes-Ol&eacute;ron region on the Atlantic coast.
			Depending upon availability, prawns, clams and sea urchins can also be added to your plateau de fruits de mer, which will be served with 
			bread and butter. A nice selection of mostly Loire valley white wines complements the bivalve-centric menu, and a convivial atmosphere 
			is created by the jovial oyster shuckers and many local regulars. <br /><br /><em>&#8226; 3 rue de Montfaucon, 6th, +33 1 44 41 10 07. M&eacute;tro: Mabillon or 
			Saint Germain des Pres. Open Tues&#8211;Sun for lunch and dinner. Average &euro;35. No reservations </em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Mac&eacute;o</h3>
			<img src="images/rt4.jpeg" alt="Mac&eacute;o" width="250px" />
			<p>Run by Englishman Mark Williamson &#8211; whose Willi's Wine Bar - around the corner is a favourite local bolthole for Parisian oenophiles &#8211;
			this handsome restaurant with oxblood walls, wedding cake mouldings and parquet floors overlooks the Palais Royal in the heart of Paris. 
			Chef Thierry Bourbonnais not only includes many vegetable dishes on his menu &#8211; making this a good choice for vegetarians &#8211; but features 
			regularly changing tasting menus themed around a single vegetable, such as asparagus or tomatoes. Dishes like scallops marinated in sea weed
			oil on a bed of quinoa and wild sea bass with baby carrots and mange toute on a bed of cumin-scented bulghur show off his cosmopolitan style.
			Excellent wine list. <br /><br /><em>&#8226; 15 rue des Petits-Champs, 1st, +33 1 42 97 53 85. M&eacute;tro: Pyramides or Palais Royal. Open for lunch and dinner Mon-Fri,
			Sat dinner only. Closed Sun. Prix-fixe menus &euro;33 (vegetarian), &euro;38 and &euro;48; average &agrave; la carte &euro;60</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Spring</h3>
			<img src="images/rt5.jpeg" alt="Spring" width="250px" />
			<p>Ever since Chicago-born chef Daniel Rose moved from the 9th arrondissement to a renovated 17th-century house in Les Halles in July 2010, 
			he's been playing to a packed house with his inventive cuisine du marche menu. This talented American shows off just how cosmopolitan the 
			city's culinary talent pool has become, and Parisians have been swooning over dishes such as Basque country trout with avocado and coriander 
			flowers and grilled New Caledonian prawns on a bed of shaved baby fennel. There's also Buvette (wine bar) in the basement, with a selection 
			of charcuterie, cheese and several plats du jour; and with reservations tough to land for a table upstairs, it's a good bet for anyone who 
			wants to taste Rose's wares without going through the reservation wringer. <br /><br /><em>&#8226; 6 rue Bailleul, 1st, + 33 1 45 96 05 72. M&eacute;tro: Louvre-Rivoli. 
			Restaurant open for dinner Tues-Sat, lunch Wed-Fri; Buvette open for dinner Tues-Sat. Restaurant average &euro;150; Buvette average &euro;50</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Les Tablettes</h3>
			<img src="images/rt6.jpeg" alt="Les Tablettes" width="250px" />
			<p>Signalling a revival of the serious, dressed-up restaurant in Paris (which had lost out as a vehicle for young chefs going out on their
			own in favour of the bistro) chef Jean-Louis Nomicos's new table in the swanky 16th arrondissement has a dramatic modern basket-weave 
			interior by French interior designer Anne-C&eacute;cile Comar and a dog's leg banquette upholstered in apricot velvet. Nomicos, who most recently 
			cooked at long-running society restaurant Lasserre, trained with Alain Ducasse and is originally from Marseille &#8211; which explains the
			produce-centric nature of his excellent contemporary French cooking and its Provencal accent with a starter such as squid and artichokes 
			arigoule (cooked with white wine, lemon and herbs) and veal sweetbreads with a confetti of lemon pulp offering good examples of his style. 
			<br /><br /><em>&#8226; 16 avenue Bugeaud, 16th,+33 1 56 28 16 16. M&eacute;tro: Victor Hugo. Open daily for lunch and dinner. Lunch menu &euro;58; tasting menus &euro;80, &euro;120 
			and &euro;150; &agrave; la carte &euro;90</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Le Stella</h3>
			<img src="images/rt7.jpeg" alt="Le Stella" width="250px" />
			<p>Since most of Paris's storied brasseries are now owned by corporate chains and serve wiltingly mediocre food, it's a pleasure to head to 
			one of the last remaining independent ones in a quiet corner of the silk-stocking 16th arrondissement for a fine feed of such well-prepared 
			French classics as onion soup, escargots, sole meuni&egrave;re, steak tartare, roast lamb and other Gallic standards. The people-watching here might
			be subtitled "the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie", service is efficient and this place has what the French call du gueule, or real character.
			<br /><br /><em>&#8226; 133, avenue Victor Hugo, 16th, +33 1 56 90 56 00. M&eacute;tro: Victor Hugo. Open daily for lunch and dinner. Average &euro;45</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Thoumieux</h3>
			<img src="images/rt8.jpeg" alt="Thoumieux" width="250px" />
			<p>Previously head chef at the glamorous Les Ambassadeurs at the Hotel de Crillon, chef Jean-Francois Pi&egrave;ge went out on his own two years
			ago when he rebooted Thoumieux, a long-running Left Bank brasserie known for its cassoulet and huge resident cat. While the new menu and slick
			Manhattan supper club d&eacute;cor at this address created a lot of buzz, this gastronomically witty young chef's talent was never really on display 
			here until he opened an intimate first-floor restaurant with a Las Vegas, rat-pack decor by Parisian interior designer India Mahdavi at the same 
			address last autumn. A veteran of several Alain Ducasse kitchens, the very shrewd Pi&egrave;ge understood that the traditional French restaurant 
			experience needed tweaking &#8211; people go out now to have a good time, eschew formatted formality, and don't always want the three-step 
			performance of starter, main and pudding. So here you can order a single dish, maybe a delicious riff on paella comprised of lobster,
			langoustines, squid, baby clams and cockles in a saffron-spiked shellfish fumet, and still get a suite of hors d'oeuvres to start, 
			a cheese course and dessert. Not surprisingly, this restaurant just won two Michelin stars in one fell swoop. 
			<br /><br /><em>&#8226; 79 rue Saint Dominique, 7th, +33 1 47 05 79 00. Open daily for dinner, average cost</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Yam'Tcha</h3>
			<img src="images/rt9.jpeg" alt="Yam'Tcha" width="250px" />
			<p>After training with chef Pascal Barbot at the three-star L'Astrance, young Burgundy-born cook Adeline Grattard &#8211; one of the still rare female 
			chefs in Paris &#8211; did a stint in Hong Kong during which she fell in love with Asian produce and cooking techniques and met her husband
			Chiwah, who works as the tea steward (as an alternative to wine, you can be served a different tea with every course of your meal here). 
			At their small charming restaurant near Les Halles, with a beamed ceiling and ancient stone walls, Grattard's tasting menus change 
			according to her daily shop, but dishes such as grilled scallops on a bed of bean sprouts in bright green wild-garlic sauce and a superb 
			dessert of homemade ginger ice-cream with avocado slices and passion fruit deliciously display the finely honed culinary technique and 
			imagination that won her a Michelin star. <br /><br /><em>&#8226; 4 rue Sauval, 1st, +33 1 40 26 08 07. M&eacute;tro: Louvre-Rivoli. Open for lunch and dinner Wed-Sat, 
			Sun dinner only. Prix-fixe menus &euro;50 and &euro;85</em></p><br />
			<hr /><br />
			<h3>Ze Kitchen Galerie</h3>
			<img src="images/rt10.jpeg" alt="Ze Kitchen Galerie" width="250px" />
			<p>Styled like the neighbouring art galleries on this Saint Germain des Pres side street, this loft-like white space with parquet floors
			is furnished with steel tables and chairs and decorated with contemporary art. Chef William Ledeuil's popular restaurant offers an intriguing 
			experience of contemporary French cooking. Ledeuil, who trained with Guy Savoy, is fascinated by Asia and makes imaginative use of oriental
			herbs and ingredients in original dishes like Sardinian malloreddus pasta with a pesto of Thai herbs, parmesan cream and green olive condiment, 
			or grilled monkfish with an aubergine marmelade and Thai-seasoned sauce vierge. <br /><br /><em>&#8226; 4 rue des Grands-Augustins, 6th, +33 1 44 32 00 32,
			Open for lunch and dinner Mon-Sat. Average &euro;55</em></p><br /><br />
